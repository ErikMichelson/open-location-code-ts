# Security notice

Before reporting a security vulnerability here, please check whether the vulnerability is also present in the
[upstream library](https://github.com/google/open-location-code). If yes, please report it there.

Although there are no obvious points of attack, vulnerabilities may never be ruled out.
To report a security vulnerability, please go to
[**Issues** -> **New** -> **Report a security vulnerability**][report-link].

You should receive a first response within one week. If for some reason you don't get a reply within a week after
reporting, please contact the maintainer directly via PGP-encrypted [email][email-link]. You can find the public key on
[keys.openpgp.org][pgp-link].
